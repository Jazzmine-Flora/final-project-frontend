# Final Project Frontend

This is the frontend repository for the final project.

## Project Structure

This project follows a multi-stage development approach:

- **Stage 0**: Preparation and planning (2-3 days)
- **Stage 1**: React Frontend + third-party API integration (28 days)
- **Stage 2**: Backend development
- **Stage 3**: Final integration and deployment

## Development Workflow

- `main` branch: Contains only the initial setup and final releases
- `stage-1-frontend-and-api`: Development branch for Stage 1
- Additional branches will be created for subsequent stages

## Getting Started

Instructions for setting up and running the project will be added as development progresses.
